The Student Leave Management System streamlines the process of requesting and approving leaves for students within educational institutions.
Students can easily submit leave requests through the system, specifying the dates and reasons for their absence. 
Teachers, acting as approvers, receive these requests and can efficiently review, approve, or reject them based on predefined criteria. 
The system provides teachers with a clear overview of pending leave requests, allowing them to make timely decisions. 
Additionally, it offers features such as leave history tracking, automated notifications, and reporting functionalities to ensure transparency and accountability in managing student leaves. 
Overall, the system enhances communication, reduces administrative burden, and fosters a more organized approach to handling student absences.
